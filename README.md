## Permissions
This project provides a comprehensive permissions management system that allows users to control access to resources within the application.
Users can log in and perform various functions found in the Identity Framework, including adding phone numbers, changing email addresses, 
changing passwords, and enabling two-factor authentication (2FA).

## Admin Panel
In the admin panel, a new section has been added that allows administrators to assign roles to users, and manage permissions for each role. 
This includes the ability to view, create, edit, and delete resources within the application.

## Permission Management
The permission management system allows administrators to create and manage permissions for each role.  
Permissions can be granted or revoked for specific actions within the application, such as viewing, creating, editing, or deleting resources.

## Role-Based Access Control
The system is based on a role-based access control (RBAC) model, which means that permissions are assigned to roles,
and users are assigned roles based on their job function or level of access. 
This allows administrators to manage permissions for large groups of users at once, rather than assigning permissions individually.

## Conclusion
In summary, the permissions management system in this project provides a robust and flexible way to control access to resources within the application.
Whether you need to assign roles to users, manage permissions, or enable two-factor authentication, this system has you covered.
